# Competence Development Patterns

Jayway has a culture of doing much of our competence development in some form of group. In a group, we can share experiences with each other, raise questions from different perspectives and leverage our diversity in other ways. We value doing competence development together.

However, we have a tendency to follow a certain form of communication, basically the "teacher pattern"; one person has prepared some material before the session and then presents it to the group, with various session length. Another common pattern is the "lab" pattern. Both of these patterns are very familiar to us from our time in school and also from conferences (presentations and traditional workshops). There are nothing intrinsically wrong with these patterns, but there exists other patterns as well and some patterns are better than others, depending on the purpose and context.

This website (located at the branch `gh-pages`) is an attempt to introduce other competence development patterns for groups.
