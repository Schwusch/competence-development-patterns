### Tech Radar

#### Context
The group needs to decide on where to invest future competence time.

#### Description
See [Build Your Own Technology Radar](http://nealford.com/memeagora/2013/05/28/build_your_own_technology_radar.html). As a facilitator, you need to think about to get a balance between the different "rings" and quadrants. Use techniques such as [dot voting](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DotVoting.html) to make things more effective and avoid drilling down in topics before most items are up on the whiteboard.

#### Preparation
1-2 facilitator(s). Lots of post-its and pens.

#### Pros
Also good for sharing findings and experiences from projects and spikes. The end result can be interesting for sales and other parts of the organisation to read

#### Cons
Need to balance group size and diversity before the session - a large group does not guarantee a better outcome than a small group.
