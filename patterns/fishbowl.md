### Fishbowl

#### Context
There is a need for a discussion or debate within the group.

#### Description
See [Fishbowl_(conversation)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_(conversation)). Also, ideally, the facilitator should take notes and post them after session is over. The fish bowl pattern is best used when it’s not practical to have a normal.

#### Preparation
It’s good if the facilitator of the fish bowl prepares a few questions and directions for the session.

#### Pros
Good for "hot topic" discussions. In a fishbowl, talking space gets coupled to physical space, so the amount of talking is usually more even distributed than otherwise. It’s overall good for individuals to practice/analyze rhetorics and also to listen to the rest of the group.

#### Cons
If there is an official or unofficial leader of the group, people tend to value his/her opinions more than someone else’s and that’s not good for exploring the groups different opinions.
