### Tutorial

#### Context
The group needs hands-on experience with a technology or idea.

#### Description
A tutorial is a form of lab. The web is full of tutorials, so the preparation cost is very low. Also, there is a good chance that tutorial is tried by many people before you, possibly raising the quality of the lab.

You can have a tutorial and a problem based lab in sequence: getting to know the idea in the tutorial and then applying it in the problem based lab.

#### Preparation
Prepare a short introduction before the lab. Why is the subject interesting in the first place?

#### Pros
Practical experience on the subject.

#### Cons
This type of lab is sometimes too guided, which means that there is no actual thinking going on by the participants. However, it's a good place to start.
