### Round table

#### Context
There's a need for exploring the landscape together.

#### Description
A round table is a fast way to share anything. Each participant gets 2-3 minutes to say anything they have in mind - hopefully something they think that the group would benefit from hearing/knowing.

#### Preparation
Make the group know that there will be a round table and that they need to find something to talk about. It could be a blog post they’ve read, something from a podcast, twitter, etc. There’s shouldn’t be any more individual preparation than this. It's also good to have someone writing things down as share in electronic form afterwards.

#### Pros
Good for getting everyone to participate. Also good for "team spirit", group membership. Items from this session can “feed” other sessions with possible content.

#### Cons
Only gives a very shallow understanding on each subject, so don’t do this pattern every competence occasion. Also, the topics probably have no connection to each other, so the feeling afterwards will probably somewhat shattered.
