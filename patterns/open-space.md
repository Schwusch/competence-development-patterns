### Open Space

#### Context
Some members of the group has different experiences and/or problems and would like to discuss them with others. Other members of the group want input on other’s experiences and problems.

#### Description [[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology):

Event process:
 * Opening Circle (agenda co-creation process at the start, without the facilitator helping / synthesizing / suggesting / reducing topics)
 * Facilitator’s explanation of principles and law (calling them guidelines, invitations, whatever)
 * Multiple conversations ideally happening around the same big space, ideally several discussion sessions across time (without the facilitator helping those groups)
 * Closing Circle (comment and reflection)

Principles:
 1. Whoever comes is [sic] the right people
 1. Wherever it is, is the right place
 1. Whatever happens is the only thing that could have, be prepared to be surprised!
 1. When it's over, it's over (within this session)

Law of two feet: If at any time during our time together you find yourself in any situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet, go someplace else.

It’s good if the session leader takes notes.

#### Preparation
Each participant tries to prepare a few ideas for the post-up, if possible.

#### Pros
Most important and interesting topics tend to get crowded, which is noteworthy for the future.

#### Cons
Relies on some properties of the group that is not always there, such as diverse experiences, willingness to share, communication skills, etc.
