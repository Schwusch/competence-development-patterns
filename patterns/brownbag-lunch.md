### Brownbag lunch

![Local Image](../images/brownbag.jpg)

#### Context
There are a lot of good presentations online and we all need to eat lunch.

#### Description
The group decides on a video presentation to view during lunch and lunch can be ordered in beforehand. It's useful to have a short discussion afterwards, to share thoughts and insights.

#### Preparation
A computer connected to a projector, good speakers, good internet connection.

#### Pros
Basically free (for the company). Lots of material available on the web.

#### Cons
Workers work for free, since it's usually not allowed to write this time up as working time. We need breaks from work and watching a presentation on technology is not so relaxing for everyone.

#### Pitfalls
When starting with brownbag sessions, it’s common that there is a lot of ideas for presentations to show, which is nice. However, over time, the amount of good ideas tend to decline and the quality of presentation declines as well, which leads to less people being interested in participating. Therefore, it’s discouraged to have weekly brownbag sessions. Instead, have a policy "we try to have brownbag sessions every week, if the quality can be kept high enough, otherwise we’ll wait".
