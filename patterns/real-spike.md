### Real World Spike

![Local Image](../images/real-world-spike.jpg)

#### Context
Someone has an interesting real world problem that would be good for the group to solve.

#### Description
Think of this either as a spike before a project or during a project. The spike could be specific (i.e. "implement a cache in Redis") or more general. There’s no solution available yet and we help each other out exploring.

#### Preparation
It depends on the problem, but you should at least think about if there is a need for installing software on the group members’ machines before the session.

#### Pros
The group gets to explore the subject and the problem, which if often valuable. Also, the person with the problem gets some input and guidance.

#### Cons
Sometimes, there is no solution to the problem. Also, it might not be realistic to solve in the time frame. Maybe it would have been better to label it as Research and Development and give a fewer number of people a longer period of time.
