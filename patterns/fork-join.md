### Fork/join (organisational pattern)

#### Context
In order to be effective, the group needs to divide itself into smaller groups.

#### Description
For many competence development patterns, there is a need for dividing a group into smaller ones. Traditionally, when the session is done, the group re-joins and report back. However, this is very time consuming and often boring, even if it’s just 2-3 minutes per small group. We think that it’s better to organize the re-join as a retrospective debriefing where the individuals share their observations, thoughts and feelings.

#### Preparation
For some sessions, it can be good to divide the group in beforehand, but often not.
