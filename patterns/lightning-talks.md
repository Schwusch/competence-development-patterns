### Lightning talks

#### Context
There is so much new stuff happening in the world. At the same time, some of the older techniques and concepts are still valid in the right situations. We don't have the time to cover everything.

#### Description
A lightning talk is basically just a short talk and it's usually performed together with other lightning talks. Since the talk is short, it can only give a brief introduction to a subject.

#### Preparation
Every lightning talk presenter needs time to prepare their session.

#### Pros
It lowers the barrier for entry for presenters, since longer presentations can be stressful to prepare. Many lightning talks together can cover many things in a short amount of time, which is good when there is lot of new things that the group needs to know. Also, the variation of speakers is good for the group, moving to a dynamic where many contribute to the competence development of the group instead of just a few.

#### Cons
Preparing a short talk can still take a lot of time. There is never time to dive into the details, so everything's superficial knowledge.
