### Book club

#### Context
Books are good sources of information. Reading them together with others motivates and encourages discussion.

#### Description
There are [many ways](https://www.google.se/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&es_th=1&ie=UTF-8#q=book+club+how+to+organize) to arrange a book club, but a common pattern within an organisation is that you form a group around a topic, decide on a book and on the reading pace, and book the first "real" meeting (where you discuss the content of the read chapters).

#### Preparation
Choosing a book together is not easy, but one way of deciding is to let everybody list a few books and then have a voting session to decide. Each meetup needs a bit of preparation in order for discussion to be effective.

#### Pros
Higher motivation for the individuals to actually read the book. Discussion with others on what you've just read is often valuable and forces you to understand the subject in a deeper way.

#### Cons
Time consuming. Workers work for free, since they are reading the book on their free time.
